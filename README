Generates diplomas in bulk. Each diploma is saved as a PDF and the link is sent by email to the recipient. 

The work is done by generar_constancias.php. It queries a db table and gets info of diplomas pending to be generated. Then, 
for each diploma it grabs the corresponding template (which should be in the templates directory), adds the name of the person, 
saves it in a directory and emails a link to it.

Things to consider:
 - Modify constants.php with the proper values for your servers. 
 
- This uses the FPDF library to generate the PDF. If you want to do additional stuff with your PDF, look into the 
 FPDF documentation (http://www.fpdf.org).
 
 - You need to set up a web server and the directory where you save the diplomas needs to be configured so 
 that it accessible through the web.
 
 - Templates need to be registered in a db table (yes, I currently do it through a manual query). No biggie for me, but you 
 might want to add a web back-end to manage this. Registering the template basically consists of saying what event this diploma 
 corresponds to, what is the name of the template file, and in which coordinates it should drop the name. You can do the math 
 to determine the coordinates for your template, or you can simply do trial and error until you get it where you want :).
 
 - It is possible to use other fonts. First, you need the file in TCPDF format (a .php and .z file). There are several websites 
 that do this conversion for free (ie http://www.xml-convert.com/en/convert-tff-font-to-afm-pfa-fpdf-tcpdf). Once you have the 
 font files, put them under lib/fpdf/font and then change the code in generar_constancias.php that sets the font (I know, it 
 shouldn't be hardcoded).
